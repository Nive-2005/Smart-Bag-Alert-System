# Smart-Bag-Alert-System
Smart Bag Alert System is an embedded project designed to alert users if any essential item is missing from their bag. Using an ESP32 and RFID technology, the system checks the presence of tagged items and gives an alert through a buzzer or LED, helping users avoid forgetfulness.
